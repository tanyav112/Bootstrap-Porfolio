            <p>I am a huge science nerd and music lover. I studied neurobiology at UC Irvine but my secret love is physics.
              My two favorite things are reading (just about anything) and listening to music, preferably live. But my greatest
              joy is being a wife to a great husband and mother to a beautiful little three year old girl.</p>

            <p>I am currently a sales operations analyst at a SaaS company. I am also a certified Salesforce administrator.
              As our company continues to grow, the need for greater business automation and customization of Salesforce
              has really become apparent. I would love to become developer certified to be able to fully customize this tool
              for my company.</p>

            <p>I love problem solving and making process better. The experiences I have had in the workplace have really taught
              me the value of hard work and building your skill sets. I hope to take what I learn here and use that to drive
              better business process.</p>
